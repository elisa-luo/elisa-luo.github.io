          I earned my <b> BS in Computer Science </b> from <b>Columbia University</b> (Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science), where I was fortunate enough to be advised by <a href="https://www.asafcidon.com/">Asaf Cidon</a> and <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ebk2141/">Ethan Katz-Bassett</a>, 
          and researched enterprise phishing emails.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am looking forward to starting my <b>PhD at UC San Diego</b> in Fall 2023, where I will join the Systems and Networking <a href="https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/">group</a>.<br>
      </p>

      <p>
        Broadly, my research interests include security, measurement/data-driven methods, computer networks, and online privacy. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of school and doing research, I was a Division 1 <a href="https://gocolumbialions.com/sports/womens-rowing/roster/elisa-luo/17940">student-athlete</a> on the Columbia Women's Rowing team. Yeah Lions!
